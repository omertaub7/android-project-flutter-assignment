Question 3:
Advantage of Inkwell: Inkwell allows the usage of ripple effects upon tap (affect of ripple along the
container / button) which is very nice addition to the UI and implemented in most of the common apps
UI in the market (e.g.: Whatsapp tapping on chat shows ripple effect while loading the conversation).

mainly supports handlers for tap actions only.
